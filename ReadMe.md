# Project 1: Visualization of Covid Cases and Vaccinations Worldwide

### Authors: Peyton Chen, Yuxuan Chen, Mariana Izon, and Cathy Shi

## Project Abstract 

Covid-19 case number is always at stake for the globe. We want to see the correlation between vaccination counts and new case counts in countries around the world. We created a Shiny App to better tell the story via interactive visualization.

## Contribution Statement

Cathy, CD, EF and GH identify a topic/problem of interest and designed the study. Peyton aggregated the data for problem investigation. Cathy, CD, EF and GH did the EDA on the data  looking at the data structure as well as to explore variables of interests. Cathy, EF and GH explored potential ways that we could build a model based on the data and tried to construct a story for our project. Cathy, CD, EF and GH made the PowerPoint for week 1's presentation. Cathy, CD, EF and GH create an R shiny app to visualize and illustrate our findings while Peyton contributed the most. Cathy, CD, EF and GH wrote up the final report. All team members contributed to the GitHub repository either via git push or direct uploads, constructed a coherent story for our project. All team members approve our work presented in our GitHub repository including this contribution statement.
